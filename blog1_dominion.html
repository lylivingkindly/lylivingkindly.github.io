        <h1>“Dominion”: Changing your perspective on animal husbandry</h1>
        <p><i>Published: 15/08/2024</i></p>
        <p>Imagine a scene of animal farming. Does a vast, verdant expanse come to your mind, where cows roam freely, grazing on lush grass all day? And you probably can almost catch the scent of the fresh earth and feel the warmth of the sunlight? Unfortunately, that idyllic image is no longer true, for most of the cases. My perception of animal farming has been permanently changed after watching “Dominion”.</p>
        <p>"Dominion" is a documentary that exposes the industrial processes behind livestock farming. It reveals a world of cruelty, injustice, unethical practices, and unsustainable agriculture, all hidden from end consumers, who only see neatly packaged meat and bones.</p>
        <h2>It provokes emotions</h2>
        <p>Honestly speaking, <b>"Dominion" catalyzed my transition to a plant-based diet</b>. When confronted with discomfort, we often choose to turn a blind eye. The same goes for “Dominion": due to the disturbingly realistic footage, many people prefer to ignore it and continue their usual consumption habits. I was inclined to do the same until a friend convinced me to watch the documentary. Since then, I’ve been haunted by it, especially when passing by the meat section in grocery stores, where I am constantly reminded of what I witnessed in the film.</p>
        <p>Then, I realized <b>ignorance often stems from fear</b>. Once I was open enough to absorb such an unorthodox fact that contradicted my usual lifestyle, I actually felt more powerful when it came to embracing my agency. It’s my decision to support industrial agriculture or not, and after considering the hidden and the revealed of the matter, I made an informed decision to reject my old way of living.</p>
        <p>Although I’m currently a pescatarian with occasional seafood consumption, I have completely removed meat products from my diet. It’s not something to brag about, as I respect all dietary preferences. It just makes me feel good, personally. Once I master balancing my nutritional intake from vegetables, becoming a vegetarian will be my next goal.</p>
        <p>At the very least, it’s something I can do to reduce the suffering of those animals. It’s something any one of us can do.</p>
        <p>If you’re ready to challenge your perspective on this topic, watch the documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQRAfJyEsko" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>About "Dominion"</h2>
        <p>Filmed in Australia in 2018, “Dominion” provides a startling and critical look at the ways in which animals are abused and used for meat, dairy products, eggs, clothes, and entertainment. The documentary examines unethical practices of industrial animal agriculture, specifically towards species including pigs, egg-laying hens, broiler chickens, cows, sheep, goats, fish, dogs, mice, and more. 
        </p>
        <p>"Dominion" highlights the standard, legal practices prevalent globally to question the ethics of humanity's dominion over animals. Instead of merely suggesting minor mitigating actions in animal welfare, the film urges a root-level discussion about our right to exploit those we consider inferior to us—as human beings.
